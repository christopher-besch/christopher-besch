# Hello Smart People, I'm Chris!
- I consider myself a problem solver.
  Working on problems we set ourself for fun is really enjoyable.
  But solving real people's problems and making their lives a little better is the biggest motivator I can imagine.
- The bigger the project, the better; even if it doesn't quite suit my taste.
- I always prefer to work in a team rather than on my own.
  I like peopleâ€”people are great!
- Linux vs Windows? Linux For The Win! But Windows users shouldn't be joked about; they have enough problems alreadyðŸ˜‰
